# 🏢 Real Estate Floor Selector (React + TypeScript)

An interactive frontend prototype that allows users to explore buildings (towers), view available floors, and inspect apartment layouts — designed for a real estate browsing experience.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Tower Overview Page**  
  Select from three towers (A, B, and C) displayed as interactive cards.

- **Floor Selector View**  
  View a list of 10–15 floors per tower. Floors are clickable and visually styled.

- **Apartment Layouts View**  
  Browse 3–4 apartment layouts per floor. Each layout includes:
  - Thumbnail image (placeholder)
  - Metadata: area, unit type, room count

- **Detailed Layout View**  
  Displays a larger layout image and full metadata.

- **Smooth Transitions**  
  Pages animate on entry/exit using Framer Motion for a polished user experience.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Mobile-friendly grid and text layout with responsive interactions.

- **Animated Hover Effects**  
  Layout thumbnails scale slightly and cast shadows on hover (or tap for mobile).

---

## 🧰 Built With

- **React** + **TypeScript** (with React Router)
- **Framer Motion** for page transitions
- **CSS Modules / Plain CSS** for styling
